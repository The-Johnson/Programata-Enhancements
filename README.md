# Programata.bg Fix

This browser extension enhances film listings by:  
- Replacing translated movie titles with their original titles.  
- Adding country flags next to each film's name.  
- Providing quick IMDb search links for each movie.  

## Features  
âœ… **Original Titles**: If a movie is not Bulgarian, its original title is displayed instead of the translated one.  
âœ… **Country Flags**: Flags are added based on the film's country of origin. Multiple flags appear if a film has multiple countries.  
âœ… **IMDb Search Links**: Clickable IMDb icons let you quickly look up films.  

## How It Works  
1. The script scans movie listings.  
2. It fetches the filmâ€™s details from its individual page.  
3. If an original title is found, it replaces the translated title.  
4. The script extracts the country/countries and displays the appropriate flag(s).  
5. An IMDb search link is appended next to the movie title.
